                    <p class="post-excerpt">Today was my first day of the work experience at Red Hat. Firstly in the morning we were given an introduction about what the company is about and then we did an icebreaker activity.i enjoyed this part as it gave me the opportunity to get to know new people and make friends. In the morning before arriving I was actually quite nervous but within the first hour I felt comfortable with the place and people around me.After we got a tour of the office and we were brought to our desks. I played around with the laptop to get used to the layout and I downloaded vscode and made my own Github account.We had break afterwards which i enojyed the most as i got to play on the Switch and the pool table as well as talking and getting to know the other girls. The most memorable part of today was probably the canteen area because of all the chocolate and snacks there.We had break afterwards which i enojyed the most as i got to play on the Switch and the pool table as well as talking and getting to know the other girls.

                  <p class="post-excerpt">In the morning we looked over the things we leanrt yesterday which was how to set up an SSH key. After we went into the conference room and listened to a talk about agile. This was my favourite part of the day as we were put into groups and were given a task to compelete a potato hero. This was really fun as we got to add and take away differnt pieces of the potato until we see what looked and worked best. i got to develop my working in a group skills and interacting soially. After a break we then set up our own blogs. it was a bit a difficult at first but i got the hang of it in the end. i then started to edit and pay around with my blog. In the afternoon, we did Microbit exercises which i enjoyed the least because i found it hard to get a hang of and understand it.>

                  <h1 class="title post-title"> Wednesday Blog:o</h1>
                  <p class="post-excerpt">today i continued on writing up my blog. I came in early so that i could have time to figure out how to use the blog and plan what i wanted to write. the first activity was in the conference room where we listened to a talk about AI. i found this really insightful as it gave me more of an understanding of the artificial intelligence that i'm using everyday. after the talk we were put into groups for team building. We were given the task of making a roller coaster with a loop for a ping pong ball. The first step was planning and after that it was to execute our idea using straws,tape,paper and tin foil. I was incredibly unsure if whether our idea was going to work or not at first because or barriers seemed too unstable. The first attempt failed miserably as the ball would not go over the loop. I had almost given up but we then decided to redo our design by basing it off another group who did theirs successfully and making a few changes here and there. This time it worked and i was extremely relieved after all the failed attempts previous. By doing so, i developed my problem solving and communication skills. I leart that things may not always work out the first try so you have to keep trying making adjustments here and there.Right after lunch were given a talk about student life and what SETU is like. I would have never considered putting SETU as a university for my options but after that I think it changed my perspective in going to a univeristy locally. There were a few challenges that I faced today but overall it was a useful experience that is applicable to everyday life.

                  <h1 class="title post-title">THURSDAY Blog:) </h1>
                  <p class="post-excerpt">This morning I continued on with my blog again. This time I managed to figure out how to insert pictures on my own so I was very proud of myself. We had breakfast in the morning and after we went straight to the conference room to listen about how we can maximise interships. I found it very interesting as she talked about how the many different types of jobs there are in software engineering. She talked about how everyone is at their own pace of learning and experience. I could relate to this so i felt quite relieved that someone else had a similar experience and i wouldnt need to stress too much over it later on. 
                    After that we had an online talk about sports Telemetry which I enjoyed learning about. He talked about how you can combine your interests or hobbies with technology which was I thought was a facinating idea to work with. My favourite part of today was working with the Bounce ball Game on python and fixing the bugs. it was a little tricky at first but I still managed to work some of the bugs out.</p>

                  <p class="post-excerpt">I have enjoyed every single day of the week that I was here at Red Hat. I love the atmosphere and environment here, everyone is so kind and friendly. 
                    Although it has only been a week, I have learnt so much from all the talks we had. Before coming in here i had absolutely no idea and unsure what I would like to do in the future. Now I think I would definitely consider studying Software engineering or computer sciences when I'm older. I am so lucky to have had the opportunity to come here and I think I have made the most of it. </p>
