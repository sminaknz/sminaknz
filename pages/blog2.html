                    <h1 class="title post-title">Monday Blog</h1>
                    <p class="post-excerpt">Today was my first day of the work experience at Red Hat. Firstly in the morning we were given an introduction about what the company is about and then we did an icebreaker activity.i enjoyed this part as it gave me the opportunity to get to know new people and make friends. In the morning before arriving I was actually quite nervous but within the first hour I felt comfortable with the place and people around me.After we got a tour of the office and we were brought to our desks. I played around with the laptop to get used to the layout and I downloaded vscode and made my own Github account.We had break afterwards which i enojyed the most as i got to play on the Switch and the pool table as well as talking and getting to know the other girls. The most memorable part of today was probably the canteen area because of all the chocolate and snacks there.<a href="https://ghost.io">Ghost</a>. </p>

                  <h1 class="title post-title">Tuesday Blog</h1>
                  <p class="post-excerpt">In the morning we looked over the things we leanrt yesterday which was how to set up an SSH key. After we went into the conference room and listened to a talk about agile. This was my favourite part of the day as we were put into groups and were given a task to compelete a potato hero. This was really fun as we got to add and take away differnt pieces of the potato until we see what looked and worked best. i got to develop my working in a group skills and interacting soially. After a break we then set up our own blogs. it was a bit a difficult at first but i got the hang of it in the end. i then started to edit and pay around with my blog. In the afternoon, we did Microbit exercises which i enjoyed the least because i found it hard to get a hang of and understand it.>
