                    <p class="post-excerpt">Today was my first day of the work experience at Red Hat. Firstly in the morning we were given an introduction about what the company is about and then we did an icebreaker activity.i enjoyed this part as it gave me the opportunity to get to know new people and make friends. In the morning before arriving I was actually quite nervous but within the first hour I felt comfortable with the place and people around me.After we got a tour of the office and we were brought to our desks. I played around with the laptop to get used to the layout and I downloaded vscode and made my own Github account.We had break afterwards which i enojyed the most as i got to play on the Switch and the pool table as well as talking and getting to know the other girls. The most memorable part of today was probably the canteen area because of all the chocolate and snacks there.<a href="https://ghost.io">Ghost</a>. </p>

                  <p class="post-excerpt">In the morning we looked over the things we leanrt yesterday which was how to set up an SSH key. After we went into the conference room and listened to a talk about agile. This was my favourite part of the day as we were put into groups and were given a task to compelete a potato hero. This was really fun as we got to add and take away differnt pieces of the potato until we see what looked and worked best. i got to develop my working in a group skills and interacting soially. After a break we then set up our own blogs. it was a bit a difficult at first but i got the hang of it in the end. i then started to edit and pay around with my blog. In the afternoon, we did Microbit exercises which i enjoyed the least because i found it hard to get a hang of and understand it.>

                  <h1 class="title post-title"> Wednesday Blog:o</h1>
                  <p class="post-excerpt">today i continued on writing up my blog. I came in early so that i could have time to figure out how to use the blog and plan what i wanted to write. the first activity was in the conference room where we listened to a talk about AI. i found this really insightful as it gave me more of an understanding of the artificial intelligence that i'm using everyday. after the talk we were put into groups for team building. We were given the task of making a roller coaster with a loop for a ping pong ball. The first step was planning and after that it was to execute our idea using straws,tape,paper and tin foil. I was incredibly unsure if whether our idea was going to work or not at first because or barriers seemed too unstable. The first attempt failed miserably as the ball would not go over the loop. I had almost given up but we then decided to redo our design by basing it off the another group who did theirs successfully and making a few changes here and there. This time it worked and i was extremely relieved after all the failed attempts previous. I learnt that sometimes ou have to do things more than once to perfect it and it doesn't always wokr out the first time.Right after lunch were given a talk about student life and what SETU is like. I would have never considered putting SETU as a university for my options but after that I think it changed my perspective in going to a univeristy locally. There were a few challenged that I faced today but overall it was a useful experience that is applicable to everyday life.
