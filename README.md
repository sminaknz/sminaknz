## Step-by-Step Guide
### Step 1: Clone the Repository
- Clone this repository to get started: `git clone [repository-link]`.

### Step 2: Explore the Files
- Browse through the HTML and CSS files to understand the structure and styling.
- The HTML files are your web pages, and the CSS files contain the styling rules.

### Step 3: Run the Website Locally
- Open the HTML files in your browser to see your website in action.
- Optionally, use a live server setup in Visual Studio Code for real-time changes.

### Step 4: Dive into Bulma Components
- Explore Bulma's components like Navigation Bars, Hero Sections, and more.
- Customize them as per your design needs.

### Step 5: Customize Your Blog
- Modify the HTML and CSS files to personalize your blog.
- Use the live preview in VS Code to see your changes instantly.

### Step 6: Hosting on GitHub Pages
- Create a GitHub repository for your project.
- Navigate to the repository settings and enable GitHub Pages in the GitHub Pages section.
- Choose the branch you want to publish (usually main or master).
- Once deployed, your site will be available at `https://[your-username].github.io/[repository-name]`.

### Step 7: Push Your Changes
- After making your changes, use the following commands to update your blog:
  - `git add .` to add all new files and changes.
  - `git commit -m "Your commit message"` to commit your changes.
  - `git push` to push your changes to the GitHub repository.
